Hatred: You may not promote violence against other people or directly attack or threaten them on the basis of race, ethnic background, nationality, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, philosophical affiliation, religion, age, disability or illness. We also do not allow accounts whose main purpose is to incite others to do harm on the basis of these categories. Misuse of multiple accounts: Creating multiple accounts for overlapping use to avoid temporary or permanent suspension of an individual account is not allowed. Private data: You may not publish or post confidential data and private information of others without their express authorization and consent. These data include but are not limited to: credit card numbers, address details, telephone numbers or data that fall under the personal privacy of a person. Impersonation: You are not allowed to access the platform pretending to be someone else and specifically you may not deceive, confuse or threaten other users in this way.
