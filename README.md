# Welcome To My Garden ![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/welcometomygarden/welcometomygarden?label=License)

This repository houses the front-end and back-end application code of [Welcome To My Garden](https://welcometomygarden.org).

WTMG has a frontend (./) built with [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/), and a backend (./api) largely on built on [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs).

The backend integrates with SendGrid (email), Stripe (subscriptions for our membership program), and with a Supabase PostgreSQL replica (for more advanced queries that Firestore can't handle).
