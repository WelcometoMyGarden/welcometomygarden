## How we develop WTMG

WTMG is open-source because we believe in transparency and building in public. However, WTMG is _not_ a product by techies for techies. We develop WTMG for a large community of slow travellers and hosts.

This repository is maintained by [@th0rgall](https://github.com/th0rgall). Our roadmap is set by by the [WTMG team](https://welcometomygarden.org/about-us) with continuous input from our community.
