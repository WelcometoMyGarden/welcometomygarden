## Conventions

For commit messages, we try to use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#specification) again since Jan 25th, 2023, with [extension types](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/22b96b9/CONTRIBUTING.md#type) defined by Angular. Older commits by @micleyman were also following this convention.

In addition, we use the `copy` type for commits that solely contain manual translation edits & additions.
